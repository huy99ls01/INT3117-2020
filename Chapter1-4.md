# 1.4 Answer question (a) or (b), but not both, depending on your background

**(a) If you do, or have, worked for a software development
company, what level of test maturity do you think the company
worked at? (0: testing=debugging, 1: testing shows correctness,
2: testing shows the program doesn’t work, 3: testing reduces
risk, 4: testing is a mental discipline about quality).**

**(b) If you have never worked for a software development company,
what level of test maturity do you think that you have? (0:
testing=debugging, 1: testing shows correctness, 2: testing
shows the program doesn’t work, 3: testing reduces risk, 4:
testing is a mental discipline about quality).**


b, I don't have much experience in software development, so i think i'm in level 1 of testing, because i can distinguish between testing and debugging.
