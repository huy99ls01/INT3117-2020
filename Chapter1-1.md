# 1.Những nhân tố nào giúp beizer testing level 2 lên level 4 ?

We have 3 factors that could help move from level 2 to level 4.

Second, testers and developers must have strong relationships, because we can't work well if we keep distance from each other. And finally is that leaders must have good management skills.
